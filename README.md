# Shooter
My first ever Java project - a simple parameterized game, implemented during my bachelor's degree studies.

## Disclaimer
>The quality of code is a result of requirements provided by the lecturer and my poor experience with programming. I have not modified it on purpose ever since it was created. This is the beginning of my coding adventure.
