# Shooter
My first Java project - a simple parameterized game, implemented during my bachelor's degree studies.

# Disclaimer
The quality of code is a result of requirements provided by the lecturer and my poor experience with programming. I have not modified it on purpose ever since it was created. This is the beginning of my adventure.

# How can I run it?



# How does it work?

Everytime the game is launched, *par.txt* is modified and filled with different data. *par.txt* contains information about difficulty levels, objects, window size etc.
